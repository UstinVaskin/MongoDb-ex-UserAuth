Embedded relationships homework—Schemas with schemas inside
- Update your Thing.js model, to have a comments schema, with text, a referenced user, and timestamps: true
- Embed your commentSchema array inside your user model, comments shouldn’t be a required field
- You don’t need to update you seeds file this time, since comments are not required: things without comments are still valid things.
- Add a createComment function on the animals controller and export this (currently empty) function.
- Create a new route to POST a comment on a specific thing, import your createComment function and use it to handle these requests
- In createComment: For Mongoose to validate and then save your comment to Mongo, you will need to 1) find the specific animal you’re looking for, 2) push your comment to the comments for that animal, 3) save it. Make sure you add your user to your req.body before you save the comment (comments needs users to be valid comments!)
- Send back the added comment with a success message.
- Check that you can POST a comment in insomia
- See if when you get all your things, your comments come back too.
- BONUS: delete a comment (edited)
